00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.190
It was around fifth or sixth grade, something like that.

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.790
Occasionally, I would ride to school and to friends with

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.390
the bicycle.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.870
When I was bored on the way back home,

5
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.910
I liked to play a game to see how long I could close my eyes

6
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.670
and still ride.

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.830
There was this long downhill stretch; usually, no

8
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.630
cars passed there. At the end of the downhill, there was

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.470
a small bump in the road that completely crosses

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.110
the road. I would close my eyes before

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.350
the bump and open them after crossing it.

12
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.710
That was my sign. Each time, I increased the

13
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.790
distance from the bump.

14
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.430
5 meters, 12 meters, past the tree near

15
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.870
the garden.

16
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.240
There was one time that I started really far from the bump.

17
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.520
So far that it was barely visible.

18
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.790
I told myself I would count to 10, and if I

19
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.070
hadn’t reached the bump, I’d open my

20
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.310
eyes. I closed my eyes and started counting.

21
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.960
One. Two.

22
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.950
Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

23
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.280
Right before I reached ten, I toppled over into

24
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.030
a field. I remember standing up

25
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.750
and saying to myself, “Wow, I’m an idiot.”

26
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.190
Letting go of the handlebars while my eyes were

27
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.990
closed… What was I thinking?

28
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.710
I looked at my hands, and they were all scraped up.

29
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.310
They just burned. I could feel the pulse in every

30
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.910
part of my hand. My legs were full

31
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.270
of cuts, and blood wouldn’t stop dripping from my lip.

32
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.590
For the first time, I felt that my body was truly fragile.

33
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.030
Sometimes, I think about how lucky I was. what would have

34
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.870
happened if instead of a wheat field there were a lot of

35
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.670
stones? Or if a car had hit me?

36
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.550
Who knows?
